what happened?
what if i would have stayed in relationship
salary = 30k - point for rejection cuz i told them my salary was 25 yet they said no so 5k would hardly make any difference
may be healthy may be not- mostly not bcuz of mental stress
gharachi situation = 3 lakhs- 120= 180k hardly makes any difference. 

so even after one year there is hardly any change. 


if i had taken my first job i would have been making 20-30k right now? does that make any difference? 

if i had not listened to jori? i would have talked more politely, i was definately under his infuance, bit egoistic
